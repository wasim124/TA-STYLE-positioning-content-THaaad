                        The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of a small carnivorous mammal.It is the only
                        domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to
                        distinguish it from the wild members of the family. A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat
                        or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact. Domestic cats are valued by
                        humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized
                        by various cat registries.

                        The dog or domestic dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated
                        descendant of the wolf which is characterized by an upturning tail. The dog derived from an
                        ancient, extinct wolf, and the modern grey wolf is the dog's nearest living relative.The dog was
                        the first species to be domesticated, by hunter gatherers over 15,000 years ago, before the
                        development of agriculture.The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various
                        behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.
